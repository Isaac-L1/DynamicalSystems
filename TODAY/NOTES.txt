Progress:
- Reran the escape times height/distance
    - Results that make more sense.
    - Distance still has an effect.
    - The effect is independent - chi-squared
- Mathematica vector field
    - Equilibria not as strange as we thought
    - Doesn't cross a saddle but crosses a saddle manifold
- Sims+eqs for dn=0.005 and dn=0.0001
- Function to get coco to calculate the equilibrium points

- Plot mean + domino escapes
- indicate probability for each escape

- Pick beta = 0.1
- bifurcatoin diagram for delta nu
- Check the regimes against simulation
- delta nu bifurcations
