Progress:
- Vector fields in MATLAB using quiver plot
- Parallelisation code works again
- Kramers stuff
- Sims failed because of hibernation

- Plot mean + domino escapes
- indicate probability for each escape

- Pick beta = 0.1
- bifurcatoin diagram for delta nu
- Check the regimes against simulation
- delta nu bifurcations



- Depends on ditance and height
- Use kramers equation. (takes into account curvature)
- Backward colgomorov equation (Chapman-Kolmogorov)
- 

- SIAM paper, kramers, I understand now. It's not a limiting solution. It's that Kramers becomes a better estimate as alpha becomes smaller.
    alpha cannot however become arbitrarily small as the mean escape time is proportional to inverse square 

- Don't understand Kolmogorov
